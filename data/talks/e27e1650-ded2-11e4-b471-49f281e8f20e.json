    "description": "Creating relatively simple applications that scale with App Engine can be easy after the initial learning curve. But larger applications with more complex functionality are still hard to get right, especially when you need to scale. This talk will go over more advanced data structures and techniques to use when building complex web applications with Google App Engine, and how to make them scale.",
