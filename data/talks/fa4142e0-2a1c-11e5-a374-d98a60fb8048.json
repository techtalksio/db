    "slug": "ricon-2014-armon-dadgar-hashicorp-consul-service-oriented-at-scale",
    "description": "In this talk we present Consul, a distributed control plane for the datacenter. Consul aims to provide unified service discovery, monitoring, configuration and orchestration. In addition to providing high-level features, it offers low-level primitives like locking which can be used to effectively build distributed systems. We talk about how Consul can be used to solve the challenges presented by large-scale Service Oriented Architectures. We explore the real world usage of Consul both in powering VagrantCloud and other large enterprises in industry.",
