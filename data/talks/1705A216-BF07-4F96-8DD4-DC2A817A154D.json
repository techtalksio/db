    "title": "Rails Conf 2013 Designing great APIs: Learning from Jony Ive, Orwell, and the Kano Model",
    "description": "APIs are interfaces, just like UIs. But while a website or a mobile app is designed to be used by a consumer, an API has two very specific audiences in mind: other systems, and the programmers who build them. A well-designed API can make or break an application. So how do developers build great APIs? What design principles should be followed? We will discuss these questions based on the work of thinkers in the areas of industrial design, writing, and product design theory.",
