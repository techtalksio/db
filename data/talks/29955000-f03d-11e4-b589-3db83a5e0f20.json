    "description": "This talk discusses all aspects of the complicated situation that copyleft now faces, including younger developers apparent preference for non-copyleft licensing (as expressed, in part, in the so-called \"post-open source\" debates - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Ope...), the widespread and common failures in GPL compliance, and how licensing choices are today - unlike in the past - rarely in the hands of individual developers, but instead their corporate employers.",
