    "description": "It wouldn’t be that hard for North Korea to build a cyber army to take on the U.S. in a war fought only in cyberspace. North Korea has an estimated cyber war budget of $56 million, and the cheap way it could attack the U.S. is by herding a bunch of compromised computers to do its bidding. That’s the assessment by Charlie Miller (above, photoshopped into a photo with North Korea’s leaders), a veteran computer security tester whose accomplishments include hacking Apple’s operating system and the iPhone. He spoke at the Defcon security conference in Las Vegas today. (See our roundup of all Black Hat and Defcon stories).",
