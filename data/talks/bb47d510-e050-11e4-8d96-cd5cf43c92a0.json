    "description": "Do you want to see the odd side of programming? The side where programming anything in a language can once again become a goal in itself? Come see a talk about Esoteric Languages, a collection of misfits and oddities lampooning and/or showing-up their more practical brethren. The talk will include INTERCAL, BrainF***, Piet, Shakespeare, and Malbolge; all languages that strive to challenge the contemporary ideas of programming either seriously or not-so-seriously",
