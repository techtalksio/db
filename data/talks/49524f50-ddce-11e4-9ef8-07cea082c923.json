    "description": "Objective-C is a Smalltalk-like Object-Oriented layer on top of the C language. It is the official language of OS X and iOS. Assuming you have a background in Object-Oriented Programming and a basic understanding of the C language or syntax, this talk will cover everything you need to know about Objective-C. By the end of the talk, you will understand how to make and use your own objects, the Foundation Framework and the data structures it provides, and the Objective-C specific language constructs and syntactic-sugar.",
