    "description": "This tech talk on how to become a better developer is by Greg Pollack of Code School. Greg shares his experiences on what helped him to become a better developer and what he typically observes in others when they are trying to become better at their craft. \r\n\r\nGregg talks about setting expectations, getting outside of your comfort zone, moving from independence to interdependence and understanding software development as a craft. Using examples from his own experiences at his company Envy Labs, Gregg goes through these 12 steps very concisely sharing many anecdotes that offer great perspective. This talk was recorded at the Code Crew meetup at Alley NYC.\r\n",
