    "description": "A couple of years ago, when I set out to really understand Unix from a developer's perspective, I found one invaluable resource for my Unix studies: the source code of the Unicorn web server. When I first encountered Unicorn, it seemed like magic to me: just by sending different signals to the server I could control important runtime settings. Unicorn allows me to scale the number of worker processes simply by sending a signal. Reloading configuration files and reopening log files is possible by sending signals. It even allows me to hot reload code once deployed. Again, all I need to do is send it a signal. But how does it do all that? Magic? This talk answers exactly this question.",
