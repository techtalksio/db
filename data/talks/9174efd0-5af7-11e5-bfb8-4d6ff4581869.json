    "description": "This presentation aims to showcase how to build and implement a search engine which is able to understand a query written in a way much nearer to spoken language than to keyword-based search using Apache Lucene/Solr and Apache UIMA. A system which can recognize semantics in natural language can be very handy for non expert users, e-learning systems, customer care systems, etc. With such a system it's possible to submit queries such as \"hotels near Rome\" or \"people working at Google\" without having to manually transform a user entered natural language query to a Lucene/Solr query.",
